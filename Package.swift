// swift-tools-version: 5.10
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

// GENERATED FILE — DO NOT EDIT BY HAND.
// Emitted per release by scripts/generate-spm-manifest.mjs in
// github.com/NativeScript/ios. The target set mirrors the assets the release
// publishes: the rolling "next" channel builds iOS only, so its manifests omit
// the visionOS product/targets (SwiftPM eagerly downloads every binaryTarget
// in a resolved manifest, and a target without an uploaded asset would break
// resolution for every consumer of that version).
